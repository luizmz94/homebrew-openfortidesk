  caveats <<~EOS
    First use: open TunnelMac, activate its service, approve it in System
    Settings and approve the protected openfortivpn, OpenVPN and/or
    wireguard-go runtime.

    Before brew upgrade: quit TunnelMac with Sair (this disconnects its
    VPNs). The service registration is kept for the upgraded app.

    Before brew uninstall: open the app, use Configurações… > Serviço
    privilegiado > Remover serviço, then quit with Sair. Homebrew's sandbox does
    not allow removing the registration.

    Migrating from OpenFortiDesk.app or VPNGUI.app (same product, earlier
    name): remove its service first the same way, quit it, then
    brew uninstall --cask openfortidesk (if installed) before installing.

    Release candidate: isolated root lifecycle integration is not yet validated.
    Profiles, Keychain secrets and the protected runtime survive uninstall. Do not
    reopen the app during an upgrade. See SECURITY.md before removing managed root
    files.
